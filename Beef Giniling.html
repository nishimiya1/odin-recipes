                <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups water, divided, or more as needed</li>
                <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 medium red potatoes, cubed</li>
                <li>10 baby carrots, or more to taste, cubed</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons soy sauce, divided</li>
                <li>½ cup raisins, or more to taste</li>
                <li>1 ½ (6.5 ounce) cans tomato sauce with salt (such as Contadina®)</li>
                <li>½ medium orange bell pepper, diced</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                <h1>Directions</h1>
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</p>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>Add beef and 1/2 cup water; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with black pepper and add more water as needed; do not let beef dry out.</p>
                <h3>Step 4</h3>
                <p>Add potatoes, carrots, and 3 tablespoons soy sauce; cook for 4 minutes, adding more water if mixture is too dry. Add raisins and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, again adding water as needed.</p>
                <h3>Step 5</h3>
                <p>Pour in one can tomato sauce. Fill the can with water and swirl to remove excess sauce; pour into the saucepan. Stir in remaining 1/2 can sauce until combined. Add more water as needed to create a saucy but not soupy consistency.</p>
                <h3>Step 6</h3>
                <p>Stir in bell pepper, sugar, and remaining 3 tablespoons soy sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally and adding water as needed so sauce does not dry out, until all vegetables are tender, about 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
