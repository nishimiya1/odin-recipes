                <li>2 bay leaves, torn</li>
                <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 cup white vinegar </li>
                <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>

            <h1>Directions</h1>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Place pork and chicken into a stock pot. Rub with crushed garlic and torn bay leaf, season lightly with pepper, and coat with vinegar and soy sauce. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours or overnight.</p>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Bring meat and marinating liquid to a boil in a cast iron casserole or Dutch oven. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until meat is tender, about 30 minutes. If necessary, add water to prevent sauce from drying out.</p>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Strain liquid from meat and set aside; discard bay leaves. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the pork and chicken on all sides; reduce heat and stir in remaining 2 cloves of smashed garlic. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Pour in reserved cooking liquid, and continue simmering until sauce is slightly thickened. Serve hot.</p>
